# LST-Routine  
Do you wish you were as punctual as your real time operating system?  
No? Well I have the product for you!! Here at *Ciolac Software*, we believe that all people are machines ready to churn out  work. The best way to schedule that work to meet deadlines is **Least Slack Time Scheduling**!!

###### Disclaimer: This is in no way a real product, this is to gain experience with Android Development, and to have a more recent show case of my abilities. This is not how  I'd market a product, this is all a joke.

## What is Least Slack Time Scheduling (LST)
Least Slack Time scheduling is an algorithm which assigns the current task to be the one with the lowest slack time. What is slack time? If you were to start a task right now and take it to its predicted end time, the time remaining between the end time and the deadline, is the slack. If a task has a lower slack amount then your current task, your current task becomes preempted by the task that now has a lower slack time. For the case of this application, I might not include preempting. If I do, I'll probably assign each task in 15minute chunks to prevent switching every minute. 

## Goals of this application

 - [ ] Develop a Comand Line Version
	 - [x] Create Task
	 - [x] LST Controller
	 - [ ] Add exceptions to functions
	 - [ ] Output schedule to a CSV or some standard calander filetype
- [ ] Develop an Android Version ?!?!?!?! 

### About the Developer
Hi, I'm Gabriel Ciolac, a fourth year Software Engineering Student at Carleton University. Currently, I've been focusing on embedded systems (thus the interest in experimenting with LST on a human schedule). I've been looking for project teams to be part of, but unfortunately have fallen short. If you feel my skill set or lack there of will make a good addition to your project team, email me at [gabrielciolac@gmail.com].(mailto:gabrielciolac@gmail.com)
